Welcome to my mono repo madClones. Started as a small monolith project to build a trello clone, it turned out to be the best project I ever started: it is basically my playground and I have lots of fun with it. 

You will not only see a wide variety of front end technologies and a couple of microservices written in different languages and frameworks, but also an emphasis on software design and architecture.

I am a fan of Software Craftsmanship, TDD, BDD and CI practices; therefore this project's main goal is to follow 
all the coding standard and best practices.

Do no hesitate to contribute and/or send me feedback on [twitter](https://twitter.com/datmadmous).

## Where to get help

[ES6](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript): if you want to quickly be up to date with javascript best practices, 
AirBNB repo is a gold mine. Read it.

React: [AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) and 
[RisingStack](https://blog.risingstack.com/react-js-best-practices-for-2016/)

NodeJS: again I will redirect you to [RisingStack](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-best-practices/).
They are awesome and they care about open source.

[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/home): practicing your algorithm solving skills is a great way to write better code. CodinGame will push you 
to another level by making you think about the correct data structure, api and algorithm, to use.

## Inspiration

[React Trello Board](https://github.com/web-pal/react-trello-board): I used their implementation of React Drag and Drop because it is great

## Contribution guidelines

1. Start with the open issues
1. No direct commit on master or develop.
2. Create a branch from develop with issue number as a name. Example: TOC I#1 (TOC = Trello Clone and I = issue)
4. Code should be accompanied with unit tests with 100% code coverage (whether it is on the client side or the server side).
5. Make a pull request.
6. End to end testing are not required for now.

## Updates

* 1.0.0 first release of trello clone
* 2.0.0 add board view with cards and card items
* 3.0.0 add boardsmenu

## Achievements

* Release version 1.0.0
* Release version 2.0.0
* Release version 3.0.0
* Deploy react client on amazon web services S3
* Deploy express server on amazon web services ECS

## Areas for Improvements / involvement

* Add a white background color to each board section (star, user and users)
* Work on board header in home page : list boards and create features
* Make UI responsive

## Repository structure

The repository is divided into two folders. The [Client](https://github.com/Madmous/Trello-Clone/blob/develop/client/) which contains a react and a vue application and the [Server](https://github.com/Madmous/Trello-Clone/blob/develop/server/) which contains microservices.

I am very happy with the way both applications are structured and working daily to improve on it.
